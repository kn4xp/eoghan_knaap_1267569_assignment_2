        Nice, I like gym training too.  
        Do you prefer FULL BODY sessions or a SPLIT routine?

        No worries. We can still plan simple bodyweight or running sessions.  
        Do you prefer FULL BODY training or a SPLIT routine?

        Ok, FULL BODY it is.  
        <condition name="level">
          <li value="beginner">
            For a beginner full body routine, try 3 sessions per week:
            squats, push ups or bench press, rows, and planks.
          </li>
          <li value="intermediate">
            For an intermediate full body routine, 3 to 4 sessions per week
            with heavier squats, bench press, rows, and some isolation work.
          </li>
          <li value="advanced">
            As an advanced trainee, you can still use full body 3 times per week
            with heavier compound lifts and some extra volume.

          <li>
            I do not know your level yet. Tell me by saying:

        Ok, SPLIT it is.  
        <condition name="level">
          <li value="beginner">
            As a beginner, a simple upper and lower body split
            3 to 4 days per week is enough.

          <li value="intermediate">
            As an intermediate trainee, an upper/lower split or push/pull/legs
            across 4 days per week works well.

          <li value="advanced">
            As an advanced trainee, a push/pull/legs style split
            over 5 days per week can give you more volume.

          <li value="beginner">
            For a beginner, drop one set per exercise and slow down the tempo.

        I keep the same general structure, but you can swap exercises you do not like

        That is a good choice to train.
