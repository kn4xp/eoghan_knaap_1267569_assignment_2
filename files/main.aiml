    <pattern>WHAT CAN YOU DO</pattern>
    <template>
      I am a simple training bot.  
      I can store your level, goal, and how many days you can train,  
      and then suggest full-body or split workouts based on that.  
      Tell me your level or say "WORKOUTS" to get started.
    </template>

  <category>
    <pattern>HELP</pattern>
    <template>
      I can help you with training structure.  
      Start by telling me: "I am a beginner", "I am an intermediate", or "I am advanced".  
      Then tell me your goal, how many days you can train, and say "WORKOUTS".
    </template>

  <!-- Tired / no time / skipped -->

    <pattern>I AM TIRED</pattern>
    <template>
      Fair enough, that happens.  
      Even a short 10–15 minute session is better than nothing.  
      If you want a light suggestion, say "WORKOUTS" and then choose FULL BODY.
    </template>

  <category>
    <pattern>I HAVE NO TIME</pattern>
    <template>
      Time is always tight.  
      We can still fit short sessions into your week.  
      Tell me how many days you can realistically train by saying:  
      "I can train X days".
    </template>
  </category>

  <category>
    <pattern>I SKIPPED MY WORKOUT</pattern>
    <template>
      It happens. One skipped session does not ruin your progress.  
      Just get back on track.  
      If you want to restart, say "WORKOUTS" and we plan again.
